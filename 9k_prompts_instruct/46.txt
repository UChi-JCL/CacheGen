 USER: That's really interesting. How has music been used to promote social change? 
 ASSISTANT: Music has often been used as a form of protest against social injustices and political oppression. For example, during the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, musicians like Bob Dylan and Nina Simone used their music to raise awareness about racial inequality and advocate for change. In more recent times, musicians like Beyoncé and Kendrick Lamar have used their platforms to speak out about issues like police brutality and systemic racism. 
 USER: How has the advent of technology changed the way we consume and create music? 
 ASSISTANT: The rise of technology has had a profound impact on the music industry, both in terms of how music is created and how it is distributed and consumed. With the advent of digital recording and editing software, it's become easier than ever for musicians to create and produce music in their own homes. Streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music have also revolutionized the way people consume music, making it more accessible than ever before. 
 USER: What do you think the future holds for music in society? 
 ASSISTANT: It's hard to say exactly what the future holds for music, but one thing is certain: music will continue to be an important part of human culture and society. As technology continues to evolve, we may see new and innovative ways of creating and sharing music, and we may see new genres and styles emerge. But no matter what changes may come, music will always have the power to move and inspire us. 
 USER: That's really insightful. I think music is something that will always be important to people, no matter how much society changes. 
 ASSISTANT: Yes, I definitely agree. Thanks for the interesting conversation!
