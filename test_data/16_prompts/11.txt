As new technologies emerge and evolve, we may see new opportunities for meaningful connection and collaboration, as well as new challenges and obstacles that we will need to navigate. Ultimately, the impact of technology on human connection will depend on how we choose to use these tools and technologies, and how we prioritize human connection in our lives.
