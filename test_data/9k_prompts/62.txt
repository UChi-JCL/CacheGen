 USER: That's really interesting. How can therapy help people recover from addiction? 
 ASSISTANT: Therapy can play a crucial role in addiction recovery by helping individuals identify and address the underlying psychological and emotional issues that may be contributing to their addiction. Therapies like CBT and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) can help individuals develop coping strategies and improve their emotional regulation skills, which can help them resist the urge to use drugs or alcohol. Therapy can also provide a safe and supportive environment for individuals to explore and address issues related to their addiction, such as trauma or other underlying mental health conditions. Group therapy and support groups like Alcoholics Anonymous can also be an important source of social support and encouragement. 
 USER: That's really helpful. Are there any new or emerging treatments for addiction that are showing promise? 
 ASSISTANT: Yes, there are several new and emerging treatments for addiction that are showing promise. One example is neurofeedback, which uses sensors to monitor brain activity and provide feedback that can help individuals learn to regulate their own brainwaves and reduce cravings. Another promising treatment is psychedelic-assisted therapy, which uses drugs like MDMA and psilocybin to help individuals explore and process difficult emotions and experiences. It's important to note, however, that these treatments are still in the early stages of development and may not be suitable or effective for everyone. It's also important to seek treatment from a qualified medical professional and to consider a range of treatment options based on your individual needs and circumstances. 
 USER: That's really helpful advice. It seems like addiction is a complex issue that requires a multi-faceted approach to treatment and recovery. 
 ASSISTANT: Yes, that's definitely true. Addiction is a complex and challenging issue, but recovery is possible with the right treatment and support. Thanks for the interesting conversation!
