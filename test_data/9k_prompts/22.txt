Virgin Galactic, for example, has been working on developing a spacecraft for suborbital space tourism, and they've already sold hundreds of tickets to people interested in experiencing weightlessness and seeing the Earth from space. 
 USER: That sounds amazing. Do you think space tourism will become more affordable in the future? 
 ASSISTANT: It's certainly possible. As technology advances and more companies enter the space tourism market, prices could come down. However, it's still likely to be a very expensive experience for the foreseeable future, as the costs of launching and maintaining spacecraft are still very high. 
 USER: I'm also curious about the safety of space tourism. What kind of risks will tourists face when traveling to space? 
 ASSISTANT: Space tourism is still a relatively new industry, so there are definitely some safety concerns that need to be addressed. For example, there's always a risk of spacecraft malfunctions or accidents during launch or re-entry. However, companies are taking steps to mitigate these risks and ensure the safety of their passengers. For example, Virgin Galactic requires all of its passengers to undergo extensive training before their flight, and the company's spacecraft is designed with safety features like a feather re-entry system that helps stabilize the craft during descent. 
 USER: Do you think space tourism will have a positive impact on scientific research and space exploration? 
 ASSISTANT: It's possible. While space tourism is primarily focused on providing a unique travel experience for passengers, it could also help fund further space exploration and scientific research. For example, some companies have talked about using profits from space tourism to fund research into space-based solar power or other space-related technologies. 
 USER: That's really interesting. I'm excited to see what the future holds for space tourism. 
 ASSISTANT: Yes, it's definitely an exciting time for space exploration and tourism. Thanks for the interesting conversation! 
 USER: Great, this is the end of our discussion on the topic of the future of space tourism. Let's talk about the next topic. Now the record ends. What is the first topic(s) we discussed? Only give me the topic name. Do not summarize yourself. ASSISTANT:
